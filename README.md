WORK, LEADERSHIP, AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Yext		       									       		 New York, NY
Software Engineering Intern – Full Stack  	            				                         May 2024 – August 2024
•	Worked on critical infrastructure connecting Kafka streams, Redis caches, and AWS/GCP buckets to integrate real-time high-bandwidth data into customer page entities, acting as a middleware between entity/data generation/handling and content serving.
•	Created services using Terraform to apply repeatable infrastructure changes using Google Search Console API, generated gRPC endpoints and go routines to establish concurrent data processing and created CI pipelines to avoid deployment downtime.
•	Modified and created service daemons to handle data ingestion and retrieval, handling SQL database entries with Kafka messages and general database cleanup, reducing stored information and retrieval time by over 95% and 75% respectively.
•	Worked cross-team within an Agile development stack to understand and create features requested by customers and development teams including service daemons and additional endpoints to enable better error handling and quicker message process times, exponentially reducing CPU time spent on message retries, while ensuring stability with Mockito, integration, and unit testing.

Agile Communication Architectures – Simulation Researcher	             		             	             	  August 2023 – Current
•	Developed a computer simulation model to mimic real-world wireless networks, incorporating variables like environmental interference, human presence, and architectural barriers.
•	Integrated machine learning algorithms to dynamically assess wireless signal data and accurately determine the location of mobile devices within simulated environments.
•	Worked cross-functionally with the Hardware Radios Sub-team to validate simulation results, ensuring that theoretical models held up under real-world testing conditions.
•	Utilized tools and languages such as Python, GNU Radio, and MATLAB, aiding in both the development and fine-tuning of simulation algorithms and data analysis.
Georgia Institute of Technology – College of Computing 					      	      Atlanta, GA
Computer Organization and Programming Teaching Assistant	           				January 2023 – Current
•	Led 50+ person labs and taught low-level programming concepts (assembly, digital logic, C) to 860 enrolled students, providing 20 hours/week of support.
•	Proficiently explained complex topics like digital logic, assembly programming, pointers, arrays, recursion, stack, queue, subroutines, debugging, and C introduction, fostering student learning through easily understandable explanations.
•	Utilized interactive teaching methods, including hands-on exercises and real-world examples, to enhance student comprehension and engagement with low-level programming concepts. Received positive feedback from students, reflecting the effectiveness of the teaching approach.
PROJECTS
Automatic Water Quality Detection			          		          September 2020 – May 2021 | Oakton, VA
•	Developed a program that automatically segments an image, determining a water clarity and light penetration value to crowdsource water quality measurements from smartphone images.
•	Utilized Keras and OpenCV for the machine learning and image processing aspects of the project, respectively. 
Stream Mon – Watershed Tracking Web Application		      	          	                      April 2021 | Arlington, VA
•	Created a web application from scratch, aiding in the categorization of different indicator species using a quiz approach to a dichotomous key.
•	Designed an easy-to-use GUI, enabling quick and straight forward use of the application.
